## Code.org App Lab - Ride Share Challenge

For the begginer/intermediate challenge, application teams have the option of using code.org's App Lab. App Lab is a application that teaches students to build, design and code a mobil app with code blocks or JavaScript.

### Getting Started with App Lab

To get started go to https://code.org and create an account. You can select **Teacher** for account type. Once signed in you can start a project or remix the current project I started called Ride Share Demo App.

### Ride Share Demo App

An example of the Ride Share Demo App has been built in App Lab. Click on the link below which will take you to the app and then select **View The Code**, then in the code screen click **Remix** to essentially clone the project. You will need to be logged into the app to be able to do this.

##### students
columns:"firstname","lastname","email","phone","password","userid"

columns: "studentid","available","everyday","comments","date"

##### ride_info
columns: "driverid", "riderid", "date", "type", "drivercomments", "ridercomments"
