## Code.org App Lab - Ride Share Challenge

For the begginer/intermediate challenge, application teams have the option of using code.org's App Lab. App Lab is a application that teaches students to build, design and code a mobil app with code blocks or JavaScript.

### Getting Started with App Lab

To get started go to https://code.org and create an account. You can select **Teacher** for account type. Once signed in you can start a project or remix the current project I started called Ride Share Demo App.

### Ride Share Demo App

An example of the Ride Share Demo App has been built in App Lab. Click on the link below which will take you to the app and then select **View The Code**, then in the code screen click **Remix** to essentially clone the project. You will need to be logged into the app to be able to do this.

Ride Share Demo App Location: https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/mUzXBd9pcFivMSswwRWyi4vTXEDoVxPLfqZS2bsKyLs

You will need to create the following database tables and columns in the Data Tab:

##### students
columns:"firstname","lastname","email","phone","password","userid"

##### carpoolers
columns: "studentid","available","everyday","comments","date"

##### ride_info
columns: "driverid", "riderid", "date", "type", "drivercomments", "ridercomments"

#### Helpful Suggestions To The Students

Here are some helpful suggestions to give the students should they get stuck with their app:

##### Core Suggestions

- Registration and logging into the app.
- Scheduling a ride.
- Requesting a ride.
- Logic rules for the roadÂ - examples include 16 year olds can only drive one person.
- Cancelling a ride.

##### Additional Suggestions

- Some features may not be able to be implimented, such as a ride tracker. Even though they won't be able to impliment such things they can still wire up the screen and tell the judges what they were thinkng. For example, students can still wire the page for a ride tracker with a map image but no functionality.
- Navigating within the app.
- Coordinate location between rider and driver.
- Chat within the app between the rider and driver.
- Send updates between rider and driver. For example if a driver is sick and needs to cancel.
- For graphics, the gold ascii color is #FFC107	and black is #000000.

#### YouTube Videos on Creating a Simple Login Page

These videos are very helpful to learn how to tie the design elements, blocks and data together.
