# Code.org App Lab - Ride Share Challenge

For the begginer/intermediate challenge, application teams have the option of using code.org's App Lab. App Lab is a application that teaches students to build, design and code a mobil app with code blocks or JavaScript.

## Getting Started with App Lab

To get started go to https://code.org and create an account. You can select **Teacher** for account type. Once signed in you can start a project or remix the current project I started called Ride Share Demo App.

## Ride Share Demo App

An example of the Ride Share Demo App has been built in App Lab. Click on the link below which will take you to the app and then select **View The Code**, then in the code screen click **Remix** to essentially clone the project. You will need to be logged into the app to be able to do this.

Ride Share Demo App Location: https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/mUzXBd9pcFivMSswwRWyi4vTXEDoVxPLfqZS2bsKyLs

You will need to create the following database tables and columns in the Data Tab:

#### students
columns:"firstname","lastname","email","phone","password","userid"

#### carpoolers
columns: "studentid","available","everyday","comments","date"

### ride_info
columns: "driverid", "riderid", "date", "type", "drivercomments", "ridercomments"

## Sharing Between Students

To share code and screens between students, do the following

### Sharing Code

To share code blocks between students, the students will have to go into the text view of their code and copy the code to a shared chat or email.

### Sharing Screens

It is possible to share screens between students. To share screens between students follow these instructions:

1. For the student that wants to share the code, send the URL for their project to the student they wish to share the screens with.
2. For the student wishing to import screen from the student who created them, click the **Design** tab and in the **screen** dropdown select **Import screen...**. 
3. On the pop-up screen input the URL for the student you wish to import screens from. 
4. The next pop-up screen will display all the screens available for import. Select the screens as needed.

** Important: This only imports screens and not the code. You will need to copy over the code seperately and update any variables or UI ID names appropriately.**

### Helpful Suggestions To The Students

Here are some helpful suggestions to give the students should they get stuck with their app:

### Core Suggestions

- Registration and logging into the app.
- Scheduling a ride.
- Requesting a ride.
- Logic rules for the roadÂ - examples include 16 year olds can only drive one person.
- Cancelling a ride.

### Additional Suggestions

- Some features may not be able to be implimented, such as a ride tracker. Even though they won't be able to impliment such things they can still wire up the screen and tell the judges what they were thinkng. For example, students can still wire the page for a ride tracker with a map image but no functionality.
- Navigating within the app.
- Coordinate location between rider and driver.
- Chat within the app between the rider and driver.
- Send updates between rider and driver. For example if a driver is sick and needs to cancel.
- For graphics, the gold ascii color is #FFC107	and black is #000000.
